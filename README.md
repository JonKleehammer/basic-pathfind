# basic-pathfind

A basic pathfinder using A* to find the quickest path to the goal from the start
after 100 simulations it will display efficiency data comparing the length of the shortest path, the number of tiles checked, and the number of tiles stored in the queue.
I was mainly testing the spacial complexity of a* with randomly generated obstacles on a 2d map
